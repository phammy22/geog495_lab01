<h2>Who is Zain?</h2>
<p>
Also known as <i>YungKeyloid</i> or <i>Syre</i>, Zain is one of my best friends that enjoys playing <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/">Valorant</a> . He is very good at Valorant, with a peak rank of Immortal and current rank at Ascendant. He not from Seattle, but loves Seattle.
</p>

<h2>What is Zain Shoe?</h2>
<p>
Zain Shoe is not just any shoe owned by Zain. It is a special shoe, a white and blue<a href="https://www.adidas.com/us"> adidas</a> shoe that he likes to wear often. He cares deeply about these shoes, ensuring that he does not do anything to get them dirty or crease them.
</p>

<h2>How did Zain Shoe the meme originate?</h2>
<p>
Since Zain loves Seattle, he came to visit me for a few days. In order to show off his shoes to our friends, I began to send photos of his shoes to our friends (example seen above). Everyone seemed to love these photos of his shoe, thus beggining the saga of Zain Shoe.
